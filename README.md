# Summer Break Tax Report API

## Overview

This project provides a web service API for processing financial transactions and generating a tax-friendly report. It allows users to submit CSV files with transaction data and retrieve aggregate financial information such as gross revenue, expenses, and net revenue.

## API Endpoints

### POST /transactions

- **Description:** Uploads a CSV file containing transaction data.
- **Request Format:**
  - **Content-Type:** multipart/form-data
  - **Form Field:** `file` (CSV file)
- **CSV Format:**
  - The file should be in CSV format with the following columns: `Date, Type, Amount($), Memo`
  - **Type** can be either `Income` or `Expense`
- **Response:** JSON with a success message.

**Example Request using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -F "file=@path/to/your/transactions.csv" http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions
```

### GET /report

- **Description:** Retrieves a financial report showing gross revenue, expenses, and net revenue.
- **Response:** JSON with the following fields:
  - `gross-revenue`: Total income.
  - `expenses`: Total expenses.
  - `net-revenue`: Gross revenue minus expenses.

**Example Request using `curl`:**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/report
```

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Additional Context

- The application uses in-memory storage for transactions, meaning that data will be lost if the server restarts.
- The CSV file should use a comma as a delimiter.
- Minimal error handling is implemented, and the application may not cover all edge cases.

## Shortcomings

- **In-Memory Storage:** Transactions are not persisted between server restarts, which means all data will be lost if the server is restarted.
- **Error Handling:** Limited error handling for invalid input or file issues. The application does not currently validate CSV structure or handle malformed data.
- **No Authentication:** The API does not include any form of authentication or authorization, which could be a security concern.

## Future Improvements

- **Persistent Storage:** Implement a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for transaction storage to ensure data persistence across server restarts.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Add validation and error handling for various scenarios, such as malformed CSV files, missing fields, and invalid data types.
- **Scalability:** Optimize the handling of large CSV files and improve performance, potentially by using streaming or batch processing.
- **User Authentication:** Implement authentication and authorization features to secure the API and control access.

## Running Tests

1. **Add Tests:**

   - Consider using a testing framework such as `unittest` or `pytest` to ensure the application behaves as expected.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - Execute tests using your chosen framework to verify code quality and functionality.
